## Commands

### `npm start`

Serves the app in development mode

> NOTE: This is simply an alias for `npm run serve`.

### `npm test`

Runs unit tests

### `npm run build`

Builds the app ready for release

### `WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER=false npm run serve`

Serves the app in release mode

> NOTE: Requires you to first build the app with `npm run build`.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined via Unix env vars and are documented in the [`./server/_env`](server/_env) file.

To avoid the hassle of having to define env vars on your local machine during development we recommend you simply rename the [`./server/_env`](server/_env) file to `./server/.env` which, in the absence of a predefined `NODE_ENV`, will be copied to your environment.

> NOTE: Any of the environment variables can be made available to the client by explicitly declaring them in the root [Html](src/components/html/Html.js) component. This extra step is required to prevent accidentally leaking sensitive data to the client.
